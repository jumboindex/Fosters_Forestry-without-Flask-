## General info

This is a fictional company website for my freind who is a tree surgeon, and created to practise using flexbox / responsive design. I have got a bit carried away, and set up a Flask server so I can grab the form data and email it to myself / sales@fostersforestry.co.uk if in production. At this stage I don't plan to purchase the domain or set up a mail server / use forwarding.

Orginally the form emailed any data sumbited to my gmail, however Flask throws an error when SMTPlib is unable to login to the mail server, so this sections was commented out as I was not going to upload my password :). I understand the fix is to store the password as an environmental varibale.
